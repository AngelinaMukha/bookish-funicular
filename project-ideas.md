## Porject Ideas

#### Smart Traffic Lights 

Code traffic lights system that will pass more cars and pedestrians than the current one.

##### Problems:
* Hard to go live without connections in government
* This problem is really hard as it hasn't been solved for more than 20 years

#### Personal Assistant App

Save ideas & notes via voice. Save recorded notes. Remind about notes

##### Problems:
* Is it better than existing solutions such as Google Assistant / Alexa / Alissa / Siri?

#### Airbnb for free rooms

Find a host to live with in another city/country for free (short-term). Need reviews, as much as possible details about rooms and hosts (as well as about visitors). Conditions.

##### Problems
* probably already exists?

#### Software to analyze stocks / games? 

Give insights about company, whether it's worth to invest or no (in terms of games - is it worth to bet or no)

##### Problems 
* Tons of trading-bots to compete with
* 1000s sources of information
* market is not stable nowadays

#### Diary with auto-analysis of your mood

Just a regular diary app that analyses your notes via sentimental analysis (NN) and 
if system detects that you have too many "bad" days - it will try to help you 
(motivetional video, posts, articles, memes) it could also tell your friends/family (if you have any) that you might need a help.

##### Problems
* there's already tons of diary apps
* dailyio already exists (but it tracks it not automatically)

#### SwipeRead - reader app in design of instagram feed

##### Problems:
* Not so many people are actually reading from phones
* pictures are distractive
* it's really hard to create a NN to generate meaningful pictures

#### Find people with same interests / Tinder alike?
Post a application in what u'r interested in, let other people to join / submit a request to cooperate with you or contact you.
Automatically find people with similar interests.

How to connect them:
> person 1: i would like to create my own keyboard
> person 2: i love to write code

Categorize interests? Search for people within sub-categories.

##### Problems

* is it really so different from reddit / facebook communities?
* how to handle large interests such as drawing for example?

#### App to share contacts via NFC 

##### Probems
* No backend required?

#### Wallpapers with english phrases to learn

##### Problems
* not so much backend development
* restrictions by platform? (IOS/Android)
* People dont mind what's on their wallpapers?

#### App to track birthdays + gift suggestions
probably already exists in some form

##### Problems
* how to get recommendation for gift?
* too much information needed about a person to suggest something personalized

#### Share short videos with people around the Globe

#### Great cheap (underpriced) products?

Idea is to create a collection of products with prices and locations where other buyers can find them. But only for products that are below average price and the queality is still high

Maybe already exists?
