## Project Ideas

### Smart Traffic Lights 

Code traffic lights system that will pass more cars and pedestrians than the current one.

E.g: https://github.com/svbackend/smart-traffic

##### Problems:
* Hard to go live without connections in government
* This problem is really hard as it hasn't been solved completely for more than 20 years

### Personal Assistant App

Save ideas & notes via voice. Save recorded notes. Remind about notes

##### Problems:
* Is it better than existing solutions such as Google Assistant / Alexa / Alissa / Siri?

### Airbnb for free rooms

Find a host to live with in another city/country for free (short-term). Need reviews, as much as possible details about rooms and hosts (as well as about visitors). Conditions?

##### Problems
* probably already exists? (couchsurfing / airbnb have option to host for free)
* Not really a business?

### Software to analyze stocks / games? 

Give insights about company, whether it's worth to invest or no (in terms of games - is it worth to bet or no)

##### Problems 
* Tons of trading-bots to compete with
* 1000s sources of information
* market is not stable nowadays

### Diary with auto-analysis of your mood

Just a regular diary app that analyses your notes via sentimental analysis (NN) and 
if system detects that you have too many "bad" days - it will try to help you 
(motivetional video, posts, articles, memes) it could also tell your friends/family (if you have any) that you might need a help.
As a last stage - app can suggest to call a psychologist or schedule a meeting with one.

##### Problems
* there's already tons of diary apps
* dailyio already exists (but it tracks it not automatically and there's no 'help' features)

### SwipeRead - reader app in design of instagram feed

Split e-book into small chunks (paragraphs) and each paragraph will be prepended with some generated/found picture (ideally - if this picture will somehow related to the text)

##### Problems:
* Not so many people are actually reading from phones
* pictures are distractive
* it's really hard to create a NN to generate meaningful pictures

### Find people with same interests / Tinder alike?

User will submit information about themselves - about interests, hobbies, startup ideas. 
And then app going to find other people who might be interested in this person for future cooperation.

##### Problems

* is it really so different from reddit / facebook communities?
* how to handle large interests such as drawing for example?


How to connect them:

> person 1: i would like to create my own keyboard

> person 2: i love to write code

Categorize interests? Search for people within sub-categories?


### Great cheap (underpriced) products?

Idea is to create a collection of products with prices and locations where other buyers can find them. But only for products that are below average price and the queality is still high. (For example I bought a really great shampoo and it was like less than $1 in price, while all other shampoos were like $4+ and quality not really differs)

##### Problems

Maybe already exists?
